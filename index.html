    <h2>April 9th</h2>
    <h3>6am</h3>
    <p>
        I woke up and went to the following classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soci 165</li>
        <li>CSE 140</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>12pm</h3>
    <p>
        I meant to stay up but was tired from missing a good time to sleep the previous day due to time zone issues with
        class, so I fell asleep.
    </p>
    <h3>6pm</h3>
    <p>
        I woke up and realized I needed to eat so I tried to find something to eat at home. There wasn't much but made
        fried rice.
    </p>
    <h3>9pm</h3>
    <p>
        I had some homework to do and also was going to meet friends tomorrow. I took the risk and just slept since I
        was too tired, hopefully the hw would prove doable on sunday.
    </p>

    <h2>April 10th</h2>
    <h3>9am</h3>
    <p>
        I went to visit a friends place but the commute was very long. We had to go from:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Yongin Bus Terminal</li>
        <li>Sanghyun Train Station</li>
        <li>Yangjae Train Station</li>
        <li>Gwanghamoon Train Station</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When I arrived people were protesting about the government with bunch of music and noise</p>

    <h3>12pm</h3>
    <p>
        We ate lunch at a nearby ramen place, <strong><em>Aori Ramen</em></strong> We chatted about stuff that was going
        on since we have not been able to see each other for quite a bit now.
    </p>
    <h3>3pm</h3>
    <p>
        We watched the movie <b><i>"Judas and the Black Messiah"</i></b> which was quite good and interesting. We were
        chatting about interesting things going on while watching since we were viewing at home not a theatre.

    <h3>3pm</h3>
    <p>
        We ate dinner and went home, overall the commute took over 5hrs which was not ideal.
    </p>

    <h2>April 11th</h2>
    <h3>9am</h3>
    <p>
        I woke up and started to watch some lectures that I needed refreshers on.
    </p>
    <h3>12pm</h3>
    <p>
        I started on the hws and bounced between the couple of hws that needed to be completed.
